# javaScriptFunctions
A function is a parametric block of code defined one time and called any number of times later. In JavaScript a function is composed and influenced by many components:

JavaScript code that forms the function body
The list of function parameters
The variables accessible from the outer scope
The returned value
The context this when the function is invoked
Named or anonymous function
The variable that holds the function object after declaration
arguments object (or its missing in an arrow function)

These components affect the function behavior depending on the declaration type. In JavaScript a function can be declared using several ways:

Function declaration
Function expression
Shorthand method definition
Arrow function
Generator function
Function constructor

Have mentioned few of the different ways of using functions in Javascript
